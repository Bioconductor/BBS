# APT packages needed for BioC packages

# firefox (or any other web browser) is needed by many Bioconductor
# packages which use `utils::browseURL()` to open URLs in a browser.
# Note that `utils::browseURL()` will return a success code (0) even if
# it fails to find a browser. As a consequence most packages will still
# pass `R CMD build` and `R CMD check` if no browser is to be found on
# the system, with the exception of BrowserViz whose unit tests will
# timeout in that case.
