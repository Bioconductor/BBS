BBS (BioC Build System)
=======================

This is the BBS top directory.

BBS is a set of scripts to build/check/publish the Bioconductor
packages.

Don't start directly the Python scripts found in this directory.
Instead use the shell (on Unix) or batch (on Windows) wrappers
provided for each node under the "1.9/bioc" or "2.0/bioc" dirs.

The complete BBS documentation is in the "Doc" dir.
