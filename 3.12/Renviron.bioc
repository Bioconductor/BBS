# ====================================================================
# Environment variables used on the Bioconductor build machines to
# control the behavior of R 4.0 for the BioC 3.12 builds
# ====================================================================
#
# TO BIOCONDUCTOR PACKAGE DEVELOPERS/MAINTAINERS: Please use the
# settings below on your machine when working on the master branch
# of your package. Also make sure to use a recent version of R 4.0.
# This should allow you to reproduce any error or warning you see on
# the Bioconductor build reports. The easiest way to use the settings
# below is to add them to your .Renviron file. However, please note
# that this will enable them for any R installation you have on your
# system. To enable them for a particular R session only, put them
# in a separate file (e.g. .Renviron.bioc, located in your home) and
# start R with:
#
#     R_ENVIRON_USER=~/.Renviron.bioc R
#
# or:
#
#     R_ENVIRON_USER=~/.Renviron.bioc R CMD build ...
#
# or:
#
#     R_ENVIRON_USER=~/.Renviron.bioc R CMD check ...
#
# Alternatively, if you have write access to the R_HOME folder, you
# can put them in R_HOME/etc/Renviron.site
