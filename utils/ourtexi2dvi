## The version of texi2dvi available for Ubuntu 12.04LTS has a bug
## in it. The bug causes tildes to render literally instead of as
## non-breaking spaces. The (admittedly hacky) fix is to set 
## R_TEXI2DVICMD to point to this script (which we do in
## BBS/2.12/bioc/george2.config.sh). This script then ensures
## that pdflatex is run on the generated file. 


/usr/bin/texi2dvi "$@"
/usr/bin/pdflatex ${!#}
