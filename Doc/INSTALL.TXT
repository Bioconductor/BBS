TODO: This document needs to be organized. Just a place where I'm
dropping notes for now...

- You need to have at least 4GB of free space on the disk where the
  builds are running (builds are running in the BBS_WORK_TOPDIR folder,
  refer to the config.sh or config.bat files in each node subdir for
  the value of BBS_WORK_TOPDIR and other node specific variables).
  Well 4GB was for BioC 2.0, maybe you need more now (didn't check
  this for a long time).

- On all nodes, don't forget to create the 'log' and 'NodeInfo' subdirs under
  the BBS_WORK_TOPDIR dir! Also, make sure that the 'NodeInfo' subdir has
  mode 755 (having 744 is not enough to have it readable by anybody
  when it's going to be pushed to a Linux/Unix system).

- On the Unix nodes, make sure bash is called with the --login option
  in the crontabs. This ensures that "run.sh" will "see" eactly the same
  environment than if started by hand.

- On the Windows nodes, in addition to the 'log' and 'NodeInfo' mentioned
  above, you need to create the 'tmp' and 'tmpdir' subdirs under the
  BBS_WORK_TOPDIR dir. They must be writable by the user running the
  builds (generally 'biocbuild').

- On the Windows nodes: make sure that the user running the builds
  (generally 'biocbuild') is a member of the "Power Users" group.
  If it's not the case then (1) the pdflatex command (from MikTeX) will
  not be able to download and install missing MikTeX extensions:
      pdflatex.EXE: Windows API error 5: Access is denied.
  and (2) 'R CMD check' will fail on all packages for some obscure reason:
      LaTeX errors when creating DVI version.

- On the Windows nodes, make sure that the user running the builds
  (generally 'biocbuild') has the following variables in his environment:
    var   value
    MAKE  make
    TAR   tar --no-same-owner
  MAKE is to allow packages that have an inst/doc/Makefile to have their
  vignettes to build properly.
  TAR is to work around a permission issue that seems to occur only when
  the builds run as 'biocbuild2' instead of 'biocbuild'.

- There is an issue with batch jobs on Windows Server 2003: if you want
  the batch job to be started even when the 'biocbuild' user is not logged
  on, then have a look at
        http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=867466
  for how to achieve this.

  help with fixing this pb.)


Python modules
--------------

You need the following modules:

  subprocess.py
  ...
  -- TODO: complete the list --

On a i686 Suse 9.2 box (like wellington), copy the missing .py files
to /usr/lib/python.
