For each new installed library (not from an RPM), the source tarball
(.tar.gz) is downloaded under /usr/local/src and the path to the
directory containing the shared objects (lib*.so* files) is added
to /etc/ld.so.conf.d/R-package-deps.conf
Then "sudo /sbin/ldconfig -v" must be run.


- The 'rhdf5' package needs the HDF5 library from
    http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/
  I installed hdf5-1.6.4 because current 'rhdf5' (1.7.0) doesn't compile
  with hdf5-1.6.5 (last available version at this time).
  With this change, rhdf5 1.7.0 can now be installed but can't be loaded:

  > library(rhdf5)
  Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) :
          unable to load shared library '/home/biocbuild/R-2.3/library/rhdf5/libs/rhdf5.so':
    /home/biocbuild/R-2.3/library/rhdf5/libs/rhdf5.so: undefined symbol: Rf_mat2indsub
  Error in library(rhdf5) : .First.lib failed for 'rhdf5'


- The 'Rgraphviz' package needs the Graphviz library from
    http://www.graphviz.org/Download_source.php
  I installed graphviz-2.8.


- The 'RdbiPgSQL' package needs the postgresql-devel and postgresql-libs RPMs
  (no need to install the PostgreSQL client).


- The 'exprDB' package needs the db-devel RPM.


- The 'impute' package contains Fortran 77 code. R-2.3 fails to compile
  the package on gladstone, because it uses 'gfortran' which is the
  GNU Fortran 95 compiler, even if 'g77' (the GNU Fortran 77 compiler)
  is installed (both commands are in /usr/bin/). However we can't remove
  the gcc-fortran RPM because the R-2.3 executable is linked to some stuff
  contained in it. On gopher5, R-2.3 compiles 'impute' with no problem
  by using 'g77' ('gfortran' has been compiled and installed from source
  under /usr/local/).


- The 'RGtk' package from Omegahat needs the glib-devel and gtk-devel RPMs.


- The 'RCurl' package from Omegahat needs the curl-devel RPM.


- The 'biomaRt' package needs the mysql-devel RPM (which itself requires
  the mysql-client and mysql-shared RPMs).


- The 'arji' and 'RMAGEML' packages need the JDK. I uninstalled all
  the java-*.rpm from SUSE (Java 1.4) and installed the JDK 5.0
  from Sun (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp, click
  on "Download JDK 5.0 Update 6") in order to have Java 1.5
  like on gopher5. Then I created the "jre -> ../../java/jdk1.5.0_06"
  symlink in /usr/lib64/jvm (IMPORTANT, also check that there is
  NO "java" link or subdir here).
  After logging out and in, $JAVA_BINDIR, $JAVA_HOME
  and $JAVA_ROOT should be set to /usr/lib64/jvm/jre/bin,
  /usr/lib64/jvm/jre and /usr/lib64/jvm/jre and $PATH should
  contain /usr/lib64/jvm/jre/bin (/etc/profile.d/alljava.sh takes
  care of these settings).
  Check everything is fine with "which java && which javac" (both
  should be found in /usr/lib64/jvm/jre/bin) and "java -version":
    java version "1.5.0_06"
    Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_06-b05)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 1.5.0_06-b05, mixed mode)
  THEN RECOMPILE R!!! (this is because the build process uses the
  $JAVA_* variables to hardcode paths inside the build products)


- The 'Rredland' package requires the following:
    a) Install raptor from source (raptor-1.4.8.tar.gz)
    b) sudo /sbin/ldconfig
    c) Install rasqal from source (rasqal-0.9.11.tar.gz)
    d) sudo /sbin/ldconfig
    e) Install redland from source (redland-1.0.2.tar.gz)
    f) sudo /sbin/ldconfig
  All these tarballs are available in http://download.librdf.org/source/
  NOTE: Because the raptor or raptor-devel RPMs from SUSE don't
  contain the redland-config command needed to build Rredland,
  then we have to install all the above stuff from source!


- The 'aCGH', 'biomaRt', 'bridge', 'marray' and 'nnNorm' packages
  (+ probably other packages) need psfig.sty in order to build their
  vignettes. Since the teTeX packaging (tetex-3.0-20) provided with
  SUSE 10.0 doesn't include this file anymore (because of licencing issues),
  you need to download it to /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/graphics
  and to run "sudo texconfig-sys" to rebuild the filename databases.


- Some packages (like 'genArise') need to be able to connect to a
  an X server when they build their vignettes. In order for them to be
  able to do so during a non interactive session, we need to install
  a virtual X server (xorg-x11-Xvfb RPM).


- The 'GeneRfold' package needs the ViennaRNA library
  (http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/ViennaRNA-1.6.tar.gz).
  Compile and install with:
    export CC="gcc -fPIC"
    ./configure --without-forester --without-perl
    make
    sudo make install


- The 'xcms' package needs the NetCDF library
  (ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf.tar.gz).
  Compile and install with:
    export CC="gcc -fPIC"
    export FC=""
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    make test
    sudo make install
  NB: Remove SUSE netcdf RPM if present (the 'xcms' package
  can't be linked to the libnetcdf.a static library included
  in the SUSE RPM because it was not compiled with -fPIC).
