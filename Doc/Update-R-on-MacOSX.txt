Here are the instructions for updating R on the Mac OS X machines.

For devel, we use the builds provided by Simon Urbanek, since these
are the only binary builds provided for R-devel.

For release, we use the binary provided by CRAN, in order to
be using the same version of R as the majority of our users.

(Some or all of these steps could be make into a shell script, but
I find it doesn't take too much time to do them by hand -- Patrick)

8 Steps to update R on Mac OS X build machines
====================================

1. Login to Mac OS X build machine under biocbuild account.

2. Change to the Downloads directory.

3. Download the appropriate R-*-leopard-universal.tar.gz universal binary from
   For DEVEL:
   http://r.research.att.com/
   (e.g. curl -O http://r.research.att.com/R-devel-leopard-universal.tar.gz).
   for RELEASE:
   http://cran.fhcrc.org/bin/macosx/R-X.Y.Z.pkg

4. If replacing an older build of same version of R, remove the old installation
   using
   rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.x

5. Unpack the R universal binary in the root directory
   tar fvxz R*.tar.gz -C /
   (or for release, just run the .pkg file)

6. If installing R-devel, remap R's "Current" soft link, which designates which
   R script is executed if you just type R at the command line, to point to the
   release version of R using

   cd /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions
   rm Current
   ln -s <<Release Version>> Current
   
   IMPORTANT NOTE: When release builds are stopped in preparation for a new 
   release, begin pointing the Current link to the **DEVEL** version of R.
   Otherwise, we will be creating broken binaries when we release.
   

7. Fix references in R script /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.*/Resources/bin/R
   to designate the version of R you just installed by replacing

   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources

   with

   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.*/Resources.

8. Configure the R build flags using the ~/BBS/utils/leopard-R-fix-flags.sh script in
   each of the architecture directories located at
   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.*/Resources/etc/*
