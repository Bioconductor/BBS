I am not (yet) going to go back and document every 
extant windows tip here, but I will add new 
items. I created this file because there was no place to put windows notes.

- In order to get openmpi/Rmpi installed (for BiocParallel),
  Install MPICH per these instructions:
http://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/yu/Rmpi/windows.htm
Note there is a broken link there for the actual MPICH software,
which is at http://www.mpich.org/downloads/
The binaries you want to install are the "Unofficial Binary packages" for
both windows sub-architectures.

Following the usual pattern, create a directory structure like this:
c:\mpich2
    i386
    x64

And install the 32- and 64-bit versions in the appropriate directories.
Be sure to set PATH as documented in the link above.

Be sure the specially built Rmpi package referenced in the link above 
is installed in our extra repos. Try to remember to keep this up 
to date. Make sure the package has a more recent version than the
one in Ripley's extra repos.

Make sure the build system is configured to NOT install Rmpi from source on
windows (STAGE2.R).

To make sure everything is working, build a BiocParallel source 
tarball and then install/check it in the normal fashion, e.g.

e:
cd biocbuild\bbs-2.14-bioc\meat
rm -rf BiocParallel.buildbin-libdir && mkdir BiocParallel.buildbin-libdir && E:\biocbld\bbs-2.14-bioc\R\bin\R.exe CMD INSTALL --build --merge-multiarch --library=BiocParallel.buildbin-libdir BiocParallel_0.5.12.tar.gz >BiocParallel-install.out 2>&1 && E:\biocbld\bbs-2.14-bioc\R\bin\R.exe CMD check --library=BiocParallel.buildbin-libdir --install="check:BiocParallel-install.out" --force-multiarch --no-vignettes --timings BiocParallel_0.5.12.tar.gz && mv BiocParallel.buildbin-libdir/* BiocParallel.Rcheck/ && rmdir BiocParallel.buildbin-libdir

(changing the package version accordingly)
