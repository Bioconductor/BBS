Notes for openSUSE >= 10.3
==========================

(should be accurate for openSUSE 10.3, might not be so accurate for
64-bit openSUSE > 10.3)

IMPORTANT NOTE: Some CRAN/Bioconductor packages (like KEGGSOAP) don't work
properly with UTF-8 so it is recommended to use LANG="en_US" instead of
LANG="en_US.UTF-8" for now.
Check this with:
  echo $LANG
  locale
Even if this looks OK, it could be that a different LANG is used by the build
system, because the build system scripts are runned as cron jobs and some
obscure settings in openSUSE 10.3 can alter the LANG used for cron jobs.
To check this, put the following line in biocbuild's crontab:
  * * * * * /bin/bash --login -c '/usr/bin/locale >>locale.out 2>&1'
and check the content of locale.out after 1 or 2 minutes. If this is different
from what /usr/bin/locale gives you, then fix it. There are many ways to do
this. An easy one is to fix the problem at the system level (so everybody's
crontab will use the same LANG) by editing the /etc/sysconfig/language file
(make a backup copy of the original called language.original before anything
else) as follow: replace
  RC_LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
by
  RC_LANG="en_US"
Again, wait 1 or 2 minutes and check locale.out again.
When everything is OK, remove the above line from biocbuild's crontab.

          Need to 'cd /usr/lib; sudo ln -s /opt/mpich'


Java
----
  We want the java-1_5_0-sun and java-1_5_0-sun-devel RPMs.
  Note that SJava will not compile with Java 1.6.0.

  In order to get a clean and minimalist Java installation,
  do the following:

    1. Remove the following RPMs:
         java-1_4_2-cacao
         java-1_4_2-cacao-devel
         java-1_4_2-gcj-compat
         java-1_4_2-gcj-compat-devel
         java-1_6_0-sun
         java-1_6_0-sun-devel

    2. Optionally also delete:
         java-1_5_0-sun
       and all its dependencies (there can be many e.g. > 20) so you'll get
       rid of all the stuff that depends on Java like OpenOffice, Tomcat,
       etc... This stuff is not needed on a build machine.

    3. Install the java-1_5_0-sun and java-1_5_0-sun-devel RPMs.
       After loging out and in, $JAVA_BINDIR, $JAVA_HOME
       and $JAVA_ROOT should be set to:

         var name     val on i686 arch       val on x86_64 arch
         -----------  ---------------------  -----------------------
         JAVA_BINDIR  /usr/lib/jvm/java/bin  /usr/lib64/jvm/java/bin
         JAVA_HOME    /usr/lib/jvm/java      /usr/lib64/jvm/java
         JAVA_ROOT    /usr/lib/jvm/java      /usr/lib64/jvm/java

       (Note that /etc/profile.d/alljava.sh takes care of these
       settings at loging time).

       Check everything is fine with "which java && which javac" (both
       should be found in /usr/bin/) and "java -version":
         - on i686 arch:
             java version "1.5.0_13"
             Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_13-b05)
             Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 1.5.0_13-b05, mixed mode)
         - on x86_64 arch, only the last line differs:
             Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 1.5.0_13-b05, mixed mode)

    4. THEN RECOMPILE R!!! This is because the build process uses the
       $JAVA_* variables to hardcode paths inside the build products.
       Remember to configure R with the --enable-R-shlib flag.
       Finally start R then install and load SJava and RWebServices.


LaTeX/TeX files
---------------

- In openSUSE 10.3, the no-longer supported teTeX distribution is replaced by
  TeX Live (http://www.tug.org/texlive/).

- If some packages need some extra *.sty file:
    1. Put the file somewhere under /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/ (most likely in
       a subfolder)
    2. Run 'sudo texconfig-sys' to rebuild the filename databases.


Non openSUSE RPMs
-----------------

The "dipe" RPM repo is Dirk's repo hosted on download.opensuse.org where
he makes available all the RPMs that he builds via the openSUSE Build Service
for the Compbio group (the web interface for this service is here
https://build.opensuse.org/).

Use zypper to install the non openSUSE RPMs.

To add the "dipe" repo to zypper:

  sudo zypper ar --no-refresh http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/dipe/openSUSE_10.3/ dipe

Refresh it:

  sudo zypper ref

Search for a given RPM:

  zypper se graphviz
  zypper se ggobi

Install (or update) the following RPMs with 'sudo zypper in <pkg1> <pkg2> ...':

  ggobi (for rggobi and explorase)
  ViennaRNA (for GeneRfold)
  libsbml libsbml-devel (for rsbml)

Update the following RPMs if the openSUSE default RPM is broken or "not
good enough for Bioconductor" (i.e. a Bioconductor package requires a more
recent version of the RPM):

  graphviz graphviz-tcl graphviz-devel (for Rgraphviz)

  UPDATED in March 2012:
  Note for lamb1 (running openSUSE 12.1):
  graphviz 2.28.0 is available and installed
  as an openSUSE RPM. However, it does not work with Rgraphviz.
  I got it working by building 2.26-3 from source and installing it 
  (default options: configure && make && sudo make install).
