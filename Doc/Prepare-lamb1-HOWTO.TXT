For each new installed library (not from an RPM), the source tarball
(.tar.gz) is downloaded under /usr/local/src and the path to the
directory containing the shared objects (lib*.so* files) is added
to /etc/ld.so.conf.d/R-package-deps.conf
Then "sudo /sbin/ldconfig -v" must be run.

    2006-12-08: 50 BUILD failures for lamb1
        on http://bioconductor.org/checkResults/2.0/index.html
==============================================================================


- The 'rhdf5' package needs the HDF5 library from
    http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/
  I won't try to install this for now since 'rhdf5' looks like an abandonned
  package (not been maintained since early 2005, no other package in BioC
  uses it, was released for the last time in BioC 1.7)


- The 'Rgraphviz' package needs the Graphviz library from
    http://www.graphviz.org/Download_source.php
  SUSE 10.1 comes with graphviz 2.6 but on Dec 8 (2006) Rgraphviz (1.13.3) was
  not compiling on lamb1. So I decided to remove graphviz 2.6 (RPMs) and to
  install graphviz-2.12 by hand. Unfortunately, after this upgrade, Rgraphviz
  1.13.3 was still not compiling on lamb1.
  NOTES:
    - I first installed the gd-devel (2.0.32) and gettext-devel (0.14.5) RPMs.
    - For graphviz 2.12, 'make check' produced "5 of 5 tests failed".
  UPDATED in March 2012:
  lamb1 now runs openSUSE 12.1. graphviz 2.28.0 is available and installed
  as an openSUSE RPM. However, it does not work with Rgraphviz.
  I got it working by building 2.26-3 from source and installing it 
  (default options: configure && make && sudo make install).

- The 'RdbiPgSQL' package needs the postgresql-devel and postgresql-libs RPMs
  (no need to install the PostgreSQL client).


- The 'exprDB' package needs the db-devel RPM.
  I installed the db-devel (4.3.29) RPM.


- The 'impute' package contains Fortran 77 code which doesn't compile with gfortran.
  

- The 'RGtk' package from Omegahat needs the glib-devel and gtk-devel RPMs.
  I installed the glib-devel (1.2.10) and gtk-devel (1.2.10) RPMs.


- The 'RCurl' package from Omegahat needs the curl-devel RPM.
  The curl-devel (7.15.1) RPM was already there.


- The 'biomaRt' package needs the mysql-devel RPM (which itself requires
  the mysql-client and mysql-shared RPMs).


- The 'arji' and 'RMAGEML' packages need the JDK. I uninstalled all
  the java-*.rpm from SUSE (Java 1.4) and installed the JDK 5.0
  from Sun (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp, click
  on "Download JDK 5.0 Update 6") in order to have Java 1.5
  like on gopher5. Then I created the "jre -> ../../java/jdk1.5.0_06"
  symlink in /usr/lib64/jvm (IMPORTANT, also check that there is
  NO "java" link or subdir here).
  After logging out and in, $JAVA_BINDIR, $JAVA_HOME
  and $JAVA_ROOT should be set to /usr/lib64/jvm/jre/bin,
  /usr/lib64/jvm/jre and /usr/lib64/jvm/jre and $PATH should
  contain /usr/lib64/jvm/jre/bin (/etc/profile.d/alljava.sh takes
  care of these settings).
  Check everything is fine with "which java && which javac" (both
  should be found in /usr/lib64/jvm/jre/bin) and "java -version":
    java version "1.5.0_06"
    Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_06-b05)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 1.5.0_06-b05, mixed mode)
  THEN RECOMPILE R!!! (this is because the build process uses the
  $JAVA_* variables to hardcode paths inside the build products)


- The 'Rredland' package requires the following:
    a) Install raptor from source (raptor-1.4.8.tar.gz)
    b) sudo /sbin/ldconfig
    c) Install rasqal from source (rasqal-0.9.11.tar.gz)
    d) sudo /sbin/ldconfig
    e) Install redland from source (redland-1.0.2.tar.gz)
    f) sudo /sbin/ldconfig
  All these tarballs are available in http://download.librdf.org/source/
  NOTE: Because the raptor or raptor-devel RPMs from SUSE don't
  contain the redland-config command needed to build Rredland,
  then we have to install all the above stuff from source!


- The 'bridge', 'marray', 'nnNorm' (+ possibly other) packages need psfig.sty
  in order to build their vignettes. Since the teTeX packaging (tetex-3.0-37)
  provided with SUSE 10.1 doesn't include this file anymore (because of
  licencing issues), then we need to download it to /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/graphics
  and to run "sudo texconfig-sys" to rebuild the filename databases.


- Some other packages (e.g. 'bknRNAiDrosophila') might need underscore.sty
  for their vignettes (in order to be able to use variable names with underscores).
  Download it from http://ftp.ktug.or.kr/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
  or from ftp://ftp.dante.de/pub/tex/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
  to /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/misc (or to /usr/share/texmf-tetex/tex/latex/misc
  on Ubuntu 6.06) then run "sudo texconfig-sys" to rebuild the filename databases.


- Some packages (like 'genArise') need to be able to connect to a
  an X server when they build their vignettes. In order for them to be
  able to do so during a non interactive session, we need to install
  a virtual X server (xorg-x11-Xvfb RPM).


- The 'GeneRfold' package needs the ViennaRNA library
  (http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/ViennaRNA-1.6.2.tar.gz).
  Compile and install with:
    export CC="gcc -fPIC"
    ./configure --without-forester --without-perl
    make
    sudo make install


- The 'xcms' package needs the NetCDF library
  (ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf-3.6.1.tar.gz).
  Compile and install with:
    export CC="gcc -fPIC"
    export FC=""
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    make test
    sudo make install
  NB: Remove SUSE netcdf RPM if present (the 'xcms' package
  can't be linked to the libnetcdf.a static library included
  in the SUSE RPM because it was not compiled with -fPIC).


- The 'EBImage' package needs the ImageMagick-devel RPM (>= 6.2)
  + (optional) gtk2-devel RPM.


- The 'widgetInvoke' package depends on extra package RGtkHTML (from
  Omegahat) which itself requires the gtkhtml-devel, libgtkhtml-devel,
  gnome-print-devel, gdk-pixbuf-devel and gal-devel RPMs.


- The 'exploRase' package depends on 'rggobi' (CRAN) which itself requires
  the GGobi sys libs. There is currently (18/09/2007) no ggobi RPMs available
  for SUSE so it must be installed from source:
    cd /usr/local/src
    sudo wget http://www.ggobi.org/downloads/ggobi-2.1.6.tar.bz2
    sudo chown hpages:compbio ggobi-2.1.6.tar.bz2 -c
    sudo tar jxvf ggobi-2.1.6.tar.bz2
    sudo chown hpages:compbio ggobi-2.1.6 -Rc
    chmod go-w ggobi-2.1.6 -Rc
    cd ggobi-2.1.6
    ./configure --with-all-plugins
    make
    sudo make install
    make ggobirc
    sudo mkdir /etc/xdg/ggobi
    sudo cp ggobirc /etc/xdg/ggobi/ggobirc
    sudo /sbin/ldconfig -v
  In fact the above didn't work for me with ggobi-2.1.6 (it used to work with
  2.1.4, but with 2.1.6 I get a compilation error) even after I've updated
  pkg-config from 0.20 to 0.22 on lamb1 (I installed pkg-config 0.22 from
  source but without removing the SUSE RPM for 0.20). But Robert has been
  able to install ggobi-2.1.7 on lamb1 after "many (many) interactions with
  the ggobi folks" so ask him for help (note that ggobi-2.1.7 is not currently
  available, Robert got it directly from the ggobi folks).

  As a last chance workaround, you can still try this (dirty) one:
  install the Fedora RPM (ggobi-2.1.6-2FC7.x86_64.rpm) available at
    http://pj.freefaculty.org/Fedora/7/x86_64/
  with rpm -i --nodeps ggobi-2.1.6-2FC7.x86_64.rpm


- The 'multtest' package suggests 'Rmpi' (CRAN) which itself requires
  the LAM/MPI sys libs (http://www.lam-mpi.org/).
  Compile and install with:
    export CFLAGS=-fPIC
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
  NB: Remove SUSE lam and lam-devel RPMs if present (the 'Rmpi' package
  can't be linked to the liblam.a static library included in the SUSE RPMs
  because it was not compiled with -fPIC).
  'multtest' might also suggest 'rpvm' (CRAN) which itself requires
  the PVM sys libs (http://www.csm.ornl.gov/pvm/pvm_home.html).
  Once again the SUSE RPMs can't be used because of the -fPIC issue.
  This one seems a little bit more complicated to compile so the solution we
  agreed on with Katherine Pollard was to move 'rpvm' from Suggests to Enhance. 


- The 'BGmix' package requires the GNU Scientific Library (GSL): install the
  gsl and gsl-devel RPMs.


- The 'xps' package requires the ROOT library (An Object-Oriented Data
  Analysis Framework). Download the Dev source tarball from:
    http://root.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/ROOT/Download
  and configure with './configure --prefix=/usr/local' (yes, even if the
  default is /usr/local, you need to specify it).
  Then 'make' and 'sudo make install'.
  Then create ROOT.conf in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ with this line:
    /usr/local/lib/root
  and run 'sudo /sbin/ldconfig'.
  Finally test with 'root' from a lambda user account (do '.q' to quit the
  session).
