Quick install
=============

  sudo apt-get install \
    libc6-dev gcc g77 gfortran g++ libreadline5-dev libx11-dev libxt-dev \
    tetex-bin tk8.4-dev libpng12-dev libjpeg62-dev texinfo make \

Detailed instructions
=====================

Additional Ubuntu packages needed after a fresh Ubuntu
installation in order to have the R configure script happy:

  - libc6-dev
  - gcc
  - g77
  - gfortran
  - g++
  - libreadline5-dev
  - libx11-dev
  - libxt-dev
  - tetex-bin

To get some extra functionalities (highly recommended):

  - tk8.4-dev
  - libpng12-dev
  - libjpeg62-dev
  - texinfo

+ of course:

  - make


Installing Java from Sun is also required by some BioC packages:
  o on Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper Drake):
    See the Unofficial Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper Drake) Starter Guide
    (http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Dapper) for an easy way to do this.
    Create the /etc/ld.so.conf file (if it doesn't exist already)
    and add
      /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun-1.5.0.06/jre/lib/i386
    to it. Then run
      sudo ldconfig
  o on Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty): install the following packages
      - sun-java6-bin
      - sun-java6-demo
      - sun-java6-fonts
      - sun-java6-jdk
      - sun-java6-jre
      - sun-java6-source
      - gsfonts-x11


Other Ubuntu packages that will make biocLite() happy:

  - libxml2-dev (needed by XML)

  - zlib1g-dev (needed by affyio)

  - libglib2.0-dev (needed by Ruuid)


Needed by other BioC packages:

  - graphviz-dev (needed by Rgraphviz, create the /etc/ld.so.conf
                file, put /usr/lib/graphviz in it and run ldconfig
                before to do biocLite("Rgraphviz"))

  - libgtk1.2-dev and libgnome-dev (needed by RGtk)


Other useful stuff (for 'R CMD build' users i.e. for
developpers or Build System only):

  - tetex-extra (needed to build the vignette of some of the
               BioC packages)

An informal list of Ubuntu packages required for R, from Herve:

make libc6-dev gfortran gfortran-4.6 g++ g++-4.6 libreadline6-dev \
 libx11-dev libxt-dev

Other highly recommended stuff (TeX/LaTeX, tcltk, PNG, JPEG, cairo, Java):
 texlive-full
 tcl8.5-dev
 tk8.5-dev
 libxss-dev
 libpng12-dev
 libjpeg62-dev
 libcairo2-dev
 gcj
 gcj-4.2

Required by some CRAN or Bioconductor packages:
 libcurl4-openssl-dev (for RCurl)
 libxml2-dev (for XML)
 libgtk2.0-dev, libglade2.0-dev (for RGtk2)
 libgraphviz-dev (for Rgraphviz)
 ggobi (for rggobi)

Really nice to have:
 manpages-dev
 colorgcc (to activate this: cd /usr/local/bin/ && sudo ln -s
/usr/bin/colorgcc gcc)
