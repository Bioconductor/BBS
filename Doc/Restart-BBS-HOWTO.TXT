Before restarting a BBS run on a given node:

 1. Make sure it's not currently running! ('kill -9 -1' as 'biocbuild'
    on Unix will stop it, but make sure nobody else is logged as 'biocbuild'
    on the same machine before to kill him...)

 2. Some R childs might have been started by BBS and still running
    (there is a bug that needs to be fixed: in case of a timeout, "R CMD build"
    or "R CMD check" are not killed by BBS, they keep running in the background
    forever, NEW: may be this bug is fixed now). Kill them all!

 3. Remove R library lock dir (BBS_R_HOME/library/00LOCK) if present.

 4. On Windows, clean BBS_WORK_TOPDIR/tmp/ and BBS_WORK_TOPDIR/tmpdir/.

 5. You can also remove the current log file (should be in
    BBS_WORK_TOPDIR/log/) if you don't want to keep the output of the
    previous runs.

Then you can restart the run:

 1. Make the appropriate change in the crontab (Unix) or in the Task Scheduler
    (Windows) to have BBS automatically restarted in the next minutes.

 2. If you want to restart the run by hand (instead of using the crontab
    or the Task Scheduler) do the following (as 'biocbuild'):
    - On gopher5:
        cd ~/BBS/bioc/1.8d/gopher5
        ./run.sh >>/loc/biocbuild/1.8d/log/gopher5.log 2>&1
    - On lemming:
        CD D:\biocbld\BBS\bioc\1.8d\lemming
        run.bat >>D:\biocbld\work-area\1.8d\log\lemming.log 2>&1
    - should be easy to adapt the above commands on other nodes...
