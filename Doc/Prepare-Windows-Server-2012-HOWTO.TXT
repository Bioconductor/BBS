** Install Google Chrome

** Install Python 2.7 (for all users)
  - using Windows x86-64 MSI installer from
    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/
  - make sure 'Add python.exe to Path' is selected

** Upgrade to the latest pip with:
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip

** Install Python modules win32api (or pywin32) and psutil

  Download latest 64-bit version of these modules for Python 2.7 from
  Christoph Gohlke's "Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension
  Packages" page at http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
    pywin32: pywin32-220.1-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl
    psutil: psutil-4.3.0-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl

  Then:
    pip install pywin32-220.1-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl
    pip install psutil-4.3.0-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl

Note that installing Python from one of the personal administrator accounts
below seems to cause problems (e.g. trying to upgrade to the latest pip
with the above command raises an error). This is why all the above steps
should be done from the Administrator account.

** Create personal administrator accounts:

  Go in Computer Management
        -> System Tools
           -> Local Users and Groups
              -> Users
  Then in Actions (right panel):
        -> Users
           -> More Actions
              -> New User

  Username: mtmorgan
  Full name: Martin Morgan
  Password: bui11Dyt

  Username: hpages
  Full name: Hervé Pagès
  Password: bui11Dyt
  
  Username: aoles
  Full name: Andrzej Oleś
  Password: bui11Dyt

  For all these accounts:
    [x] User must change password at next logon
    [ ] User cannot change password
    [ ] Password never expires
    [ ] Account is disabled

  Then make these users members of the Administrators group.

From now on, all administrative tasks should be performed from one of the
personal accounts.

** Create the biocbuild account:

  Username: biocbuild
  Password: bui11Dyt

  For this account:
    [ ] User must change password at next logon
    [x] User cannot change password
    [x] Password never expires
    [ ] Account is disabled

  Then make this user member of the Remote Desktop Users group.

From a personal account

** Install MiKTeX

  Choose the Basic MiKTeX 64-bit Installer

  - Install MiKTeX for all users
  - Preferred paper: Letter
  - Install missing packages on-the-fly: Yes

  Then run MiKTeX Update (Admin) in the Windows start menu

** Install 32-bit Cygwin

  Cygwin is needed for the ssh, rsync, and curl commands only.

  Download and run setup-x86.exe to install or update Cygwin.
  Install for all users.
  Make sure packages openssh, rsync, and curl are selected (the 3 of them
  are in the Net category).

  Note that this installs the Cygwin 32-bit DLL.

** Prepend C:\cygwin\bin to PATH

  To edit an environment variable:

    Windows start menu -> This PC -> right click on This PC -> Properties
    -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables... 

  Test by opening a PowerShell window and try to run ssh, rsync, or curl in
  it.

** Install Rtools

  Download Rtools*.exe from https://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
  For the devel builds: choose the latest version (NOT frozen)
  For the release builds: choose the latest *frozen* version

  On the Select Components page: select everything *except* Cygwin DLLs
  and the "Extras" files

  On the Select Additional Tasks page: select everything

  On the System Path page: add c:\Rtools\mingw_64\bin; right after
  c:\Rtools\mingw_32\bin;

  Test by opening a PowerShell window and try to run:
    which rsync (should show /cygdrive/c/Rtools/bin/rsync, because rsync from
                 Rtools is before Cygwin rsync in PATH)
    which ssh   (should show /usr/bin/ssh)
    which curl  (should show /usr/bin/curl)
    rsync       (will crash if 64-bit Cygwin was installed instead of 32-bit)
    which gcc   (should show /cygdrive/c/Rtools/mingw_32/bin/gcc)

** Install the Subversion client
