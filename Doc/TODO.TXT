Some CRAN packages depend on omegahat packages (e.g. lsa depends on Rstem).
Modify cran/interactive/STAGE2.sh to fix this problem.

Integrate the updateReposPkgs-*-x.y.sh scripts (currently in
/home/biocbuild/bin) into BBS -> this will be stage6.

IN all stages:

- Rename all xx_BASEURL env. var. -> xx_URL

- Use the SimpleMailer class to send an email at the end of a stage.

IN STAGE2, STAGE3:

- [On Windows only] Clean autmatically the "temp" dirs:
    BBS_WORK_TOPDIR\tmp
    BBS_WORK_TOPDIR\tmpdir
  Note: to see list of packages that were victims of the infamous
  'cannot create directory' R bug on lemming, do:
    > cd /home/biocbuild/public_html/BBS/1.8d/nodes/lemming/buildsrc
    > grep 'cannot create' *-out.txt
  (last time I did it, I got only 2 packages, was 12/16/2005)

IN STAGE3, STAGE4, STAGE5:

- The actual stats printed to stdout at the end of the "big loop" should
  also be printed into a file (00REPORT.TXT) and this file should be put in
  BBS_CENTRAL_BASEURL/nodes/<node>/<stage_label>/
  The presence of this file is the guarantee that the stage was successfull.
  Then the BBS-report.py script should only include in the report
  stuff from dirs that contain the 00REPORT.TXT file.

IN stage8:

- Check the presence of 00REPORT.TXT in the "input dirs" used to generate
  the report. If 00REPORT.TXT is missing, then don't include the node
  in the report.

From discussion with Seth (10/28/05):

- Report files: add the following fields
    buildSystemOS
    buildSystemName
    R version (svn rev)
    svn rev of pkg
    size on disk of srcpkg file .tar.gz
    size on disk of pkg dir (.tar.gz after extraction)
    
- Feature wanted:
    Provide an easy way for people to use the BBS to
    automatically rebuild and publish a list of given packages.
    This should be simple like "one single script to run on one
    single machine" + of course the unavoidable task of editing
    the list of packages to rebuild.
    The machine where the single script is run should be able
    to dispatch the task to the various BBS nodes, to wait they
    are done and then to publish the results to cobra.
